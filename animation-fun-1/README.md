#Animation experimentation

I set out with this example to emulate some of the cool UI features you see in the Google+ web application. This is not as slick as that,
but it's a start. I don't use the 'Angular Way' here, mostly because I don't understand the Angular animation pattern well enough to determine
if the Angular Way would hinder my implementation. Basically, my directive accepts a target for where the form will be moved to, and the animation
API for addClass only accepts one element.
