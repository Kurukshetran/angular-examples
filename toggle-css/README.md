#Simple CSS Class Toggle - No Controller Necessary!

In web app development you often need to toggle a CSS class. A lot of the examples I've seen around tell you to use the controller
to change the class. This is not the Angular way - don't reference selectors in the controller. If you can, use ngClick, ngClass, etc. - that's
why they are there! This example shows how to toggle a CSS class w/o using the controller at all.
